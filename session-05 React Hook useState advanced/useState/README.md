# useState: tic tac toe

## Background

A `name` is one thing, but a real UI is a bit different. Often you need more
than one element of state in your component, so you'll call `React.useState`
more than once. Please note that each call to `React.useState` in a given
component will give you a unique state and updater function.

## Exercise

We're going to build tic-tac-toe (with localStorage support)! If you've gone
through React's official tutorial, this was lifted from that (except that
example still uses classes).

You're going to need some managed state and some derived state:

- **Managed State:** State that you need to explicitly manage
- **Derived State:** State that you can calculate based on other state

`squares` is the managed state and it's the state of the board in a
single-dimensional array:

```
[
  'X', 'O', 'X',
  'X', 'O', 'O',
  'X', 'X', 'O'
]
```

This will start out as an empty array because it's the start of the game.

`nextValue` will be either the string `X` or `O` and is derived state which you
can determine based on the value of `squares`. We can determine whose turn it is
based on how many "X" and "O" squares there are. We've written this out for you
in a `calculateNextValue` function at the bottom of the file.

`winner` will be either the string `X` or `O` and is derived state which can
also be determined based on the value of `squares` and we've provided a
`calculateWinner` function you can use to get that value.

## Extra Credit

### 1. 💯 preserve state in localStorage

👨‍💼 Our customers want to be able to pause a game, close the tab, and then resume
the game later. Can you store the game's state in `localStorage`?

### 2. 💯 useLocalStorageState

It's cool that we can get localStorage support with a simple `useEffect`, but
it'd be even cooler to use the `useLocalStorageState` hook that's already
written for us in `src/utils.js`!

Refactor your code to use that custom hook instead. (This should be a pretty
quick extra credit).

### 3. 💯 add game history feature

NOTE: This extra credit is one of the harder extra credits. Don't worry if you
struggle on it!

💰 Tip, in the final example, we store the history of squares in an array of
arrays. `[[/* step 0 squares */], [/* step 1 squares */], ...etc]`, so we have
two states: `history` and `currentStep`.

💰 Tip, in the final example, we move the state management from the `Board`
component to the `Game` component and that helps a bit. Here's what the JSX
returned from the `Game` component is in the final version:

```javascript
return (
  <div className="game">
    <div className="game-board">
      <Board onClick={selectSquare} squares={currentSquares} />
      <button className="restart" onClick={restart}>
        restart
      </button>
    </div>
    <div className="game-info">
      <div>{status}</div>
      <ol>{moves}</ol>
    </div>
  </div>
)
```
